- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Carlos-ponce-programming and my name is Carlos Ponce.
- The purpose of this account and its repositories is to act as a portofolio of many of the scripts and programming projects I've worked with the past year.
- Most of the code here is in Python because it's the programming language that I am most comfortable with.
